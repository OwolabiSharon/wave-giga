# Node.js Test Workflow

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the testing of Node.js code on every push to the repository. The workflow ensures that the Node.js code runs successfully before allowing the push request to proceed.

## Workflow Overview

The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/nodejs-test.yml` file. It performs the following steps:

1. **Checkout Repository**: This step checks out the repository code, making it available for subsequent actions.

2. **Set up Node.js**: The workflow uses the `actions/setup-node` action to set up the desired version of Node.js. In this case, it sets up Node.js version 14.

3. **Install Dependencies**: This step installs the project dependencies using the `npm ci` command. The `npm ci` command installs the exact versions of the dependencies defined in the `package-lock.json` file, ensuring consistent builds.

4. **Run Tests**: Finally, the workflow runs the tests using the `npm test` command. This command executes the test script defined in the `package.json` file under the `scripts` section. You can customize the test script based on your preferred testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest, etc.) and the specific testing requirements of your Node.js project.

## Triggering the Workflow

The workflow is triggered automatically on every push to the repository. When you push code changes, the workflow is executed, and the Node.js code is tested.

## Viewing Workflow Results

You can view the results of the workflow by navigating to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository. The workflow status, along with the details of each step, will be displayed there. In case of any test failures, the push request will not be allowed to proceed until the issues are resolved.

## Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow to suit your specific needs. For example, you can add additional steps to build the project, generate code coverage reports, or deploy the application to a staging environment. Refer to the GitHub Actions documentation for more information on available actions and customization options.

## Dependencies

Ensure that your Node.js project has a valid `package.json` file with the required dependencies and test script defined in the `scripts` section. Make sure to include the necessary testing frameworks and any additional dependencies required for testing.

## Conclusion

By using this GitHub Actions workflow, you can automate the testing of your Node.js code on every push, ensuring that the code runs successfully before allowing the push request to proceed. This helps maintain the quality and reliability of your Node.js projects.
